# sdc-vm-agent

The SDC VM agent is a library for keeping track of VM changes on an SDC data
center. There is one VM agent installed per Compute Node. VM changes trigger
updates on [VMAPI](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-sapi) so data is persisted.

This repository is part of the Joyent SmartDataCenter project (SDC).  For
contribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.
